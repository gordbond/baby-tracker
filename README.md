# Baby, Sleep, Eat and Poop Tracker

This app is a work in progress. It was designed to track the sleeping, eating and pooping patterns of my 9 month old son. At the moment there is only a front end. In the future there will be a back end built using node.js. But I have to teach it to myself first!
